## About
The Roadie is a roadtrip app that provides the weather along the route to the desired location. Users can create trips along with to-do lists so they can be prepared for their journey. Also, the app offers a gas calculator so users can get an estimate of how much they spend on gas and there is a hotel map so hotels can be searched by location. This app is extremely helpful for travelers.
